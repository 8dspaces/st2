        I can tell you more about a particular pack, or even get it installed for you right away:
        ```
        pack show available <pack>
        pack install <pack>
        ```
      {% else %}
        I couldn't get any results for `{{ execution.parameters.query }}`, unfortunately.
      {% endif %}
    {% else %}
      Search failed for `{{ execution.parameters.query }}`.{~}
      Please check {{ execution.id }} for details. Index problems maybe?
    {% endif %}
