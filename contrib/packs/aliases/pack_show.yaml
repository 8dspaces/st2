          Full metadata:

            This pack does not appear to be a git repository though.

          It looks like there is no installed pack with this name.
          {% if not execution.result.available %}
            It's not on StackStorm Exchange either. What a sad world.
          {% endif %}

        {% if execution.result.available %}

            This pack is available in the pack directory. You can take a look:
            ```
            pack show available {{ execution.parameters.pack }}
            ```
            {% if not execution.result.pack %}
              Or ask me to install it for you right away:
              ```
              pack install {{ execution.parameters.pack }}
              ```
            {% endif %}
          {% endif %}
      {% else %}
        Getting back to you about the `{{ execution.parameters.pack }}` pack:{~}
        {% if execution.result.available %}
          Here's the full index entry for the pack:
          ```
          {{ execution.result.available }}
          ```
          Its source code is available at {{ execution.result.repo_url }}.

          To install the pack, just ask me:
          ```
          pack install {{ execution.parameters.pack }}
          ```
          If the pack is already installed, I will upgrade it to the latest version, keeping the config.
        {% else %}
          There's nothing like that in the pack index.
          I know how sad it is, but life goes on. Cheer up!
